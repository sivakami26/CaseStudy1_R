## 3. Recommendations
# Based on the analysis, here are my top three recommendations:
# **Targeted Weekend Campaigns:** Since casual riders peak on weekends, offer a "Weekend-Only" membership.

all_trips_v2 %>% 
  group_by(member_casual, day_of_week) %>% 
  summarise(number_of_rides=n(), .groups = "drop") %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = day_of_week, y = number_of_rides, fill = member_casual)) +

  geom_col(width = 0.5, position = position_dodge(width = 0.5)) +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = function(x) format(x,scientific = FALSE))


# 2. **Seasonal Discounts:** Casual usage is highest in summer; launch a "Summer Member" promotion.
# 3. **Leisure Route Marketing:** Increase advertising at stations near parks and waterfronts where casual riders frequent.
# Prepare the data: Filter for casual riders and find their top 10 starting stations
top_casual_stations <- all_trips_v2 %>%
  filter(member_casual == "casual") %>%
  group_by(start_station_name) %>%
